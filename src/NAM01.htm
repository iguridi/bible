The LORD avenges and is full of wrath. The LORD takes vengeance on his adversaries, and he maintains wrath against his enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. The LORD has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He rebukes the sea and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel languish. The flower of Lebanon languishes.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The mountains quake before him, and the hills melt away. The earth trembles at his presence, yes, the world, and all who dwell in it.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Who can stand before his indignation? Who can endure the fierceness of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken apart by him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The LORD is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and he knows those who take refuge in him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But with an overflowing flood, he will make a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>What do you plot against the LORD? He will make a full end. Affliction won’t rise up the second time.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink, they are consumed utterly like dry stubble.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>One has gone out of you who devises evil against the LORD, who counsels wickedness. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The LORD says: “Though they are in full strength and likewise many, even so they will be cut down and pass away.
