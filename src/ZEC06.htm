In the second chariot were black horses.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>In the third chariot were white horses. In the fourth chariot were dappled horses, all of them powerful.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The angel answered me, “These are the four winds of the sky, which go out from standing before the Lord of all the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The one with the black horses goes out toward the north country; and the white went out after them; and the dappled went out toward the south country.”  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The strong went out, and sought to go that they might walk back and forth through the earth. He said, “Go around and through the earth!” So they walked back and forth through the earth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then he called to me, and spoke to me, saying, “Behold, those who go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The LORD’s word came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have come from Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Yes, take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and speak to him, saying, ‘The LORD of Armies says, “Behold, the man whose name is the Branch!
