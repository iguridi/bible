<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 28</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>That same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the LORD’s house, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>“The LORD of Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Within two full years I will bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD’s house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, who went to Babylon,’ says the LORD; ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people who stood in the LORD’s house,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>even the prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May the LORD do so. May the LORD perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD’s house, and all those who are captives, from Babylon to this place.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Nevertheless listen now to this word that I speak in your ears, and in the ears of all the people:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, of evil, and of pestilence.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>As for the prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet happens, then the prophet will be known, that the LORD has truly sent him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and broke it.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “The LORD says: ‘Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from off the neck of all the nations within two full years.’ ” Then the prophet Jeremiah went his way. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the LORD’s word came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, ‘The LORD says, “You have broken the bars of wood, but you have made in their place bars of iron.”  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For the LORD of Armies, the God of Israel says, “I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they will serve him. I have also given him the animals of the field.” ’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen, Hananiah! The LORD has not sent you, but you make this people trust in a lie.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore the LORD says, ‘Behold, I will send you away from off the surface of the earth. This year you will die, because you have spoken rebellion against the LORD.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month. </div><ul class='tnav'>
